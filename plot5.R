# This code is designed to answer the following question:
# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
## No required plotting system, so this plot will use ggplot2
# MUSTS: 
# include the code for plot5.png 
# include the code for reading in the data so it can be reproduced

# necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)

# reading in the data
